Int: <A3><A1>But, because the island still uses only cash, the closure of the Greek banks has been devastating.

Adv: <D2><D3>Kakali has badgered the government and a major Greek bank into promising an ATM within weeks</D3> but she still feels it may come too late for this season</D2> on an island where tourism dwarfs the two other sources of income: fishing and agriculture: <A1>“We have almost no reservations in August, when usually we have people calling us up asking to find a room and we can’t help them.”</A1> A hard winter ahead may be slightly improved by 50 workers billeted in the village to expand the harbor <A3><A2><D1>but there is an even bigger crisis looming because the government has said it will end a decades-old tax break for islands.</A2></A3></D1>

Int: <D2><D3>Kakali has badgered the government and a major Greek bank into promising an ATM within weeks</D3> but she still feels it may be too late for this season</D2> on an island where tourism is the main source of income: <A1>“We have almost no reservations in August, when usually we have people calling us up asking to find a room and we can’t help them.”</A1> A hard winter ahead may be slightly improved because 50 workers will live and work in the village to expand the harbor. <D1><A3><A2>But there is an even bigger crisis ahead because the government has said it will end a tax break for islands.</A2></A3></D1>

Ele: <D2><D3>Kakali has asked the government and a major Greek bank to install an ATM, and this should arrive soon.</D3></D2> But tourism is the main business on the island, <D2>and she feels the ATM may come too late for this season.</D2> <A1>“We have almost no reservations in August, when usually we are full.”</A1> <D1><A3><A2>But there is an even bigger crisis ahead – the government has said it will end a tax break for islands.</A2></A3></D1>

# Paragraph

Adv: Created to help island communities survive when they were suffering mass emigration, a lower sales tax contained the costs of living in places where everything had to be imported and made tourism more affordable. Tourist favorites such as Mykonos fear that losing the tax breaks will make it hard for them to compete with Turkey but, for Agios Efstratios, it poses a far greater threat. <A1>“If we have to pay a tax of 23%, I’m sorry to say it but we will all die on the island,” says Kakali.</A1> <D3><D1>Food and fuel are already more expensive than on mainland Greece,</D1></D3> there are no economies of scale and little economic flexibility on an island which, even in summer, <D2>has only three shops, two restaurants</D2> and not a single official hotel. <A3>“This is an expensive island. <A2>Everything, even milk or bread, has changed hands three or four times before it gets to us and each middleman has to take a profit,”</A2> said Provatas Costas,</A3> a 58-year-old fisherman. 

Int: The tax break was created to help island communities survive the problem of mass emigration. The lower sales tax reduced the costs of living on the islands, where everything had to be imported, and it made tourism more affordable. Tourist favorites such as Mykonos fear that losing the tax breaks will make it hard for them to compete with Turkey. But, for Agios Efstratios, it is a far greater problem. <A1>“If we have to pay a tax of 23%, I’m sorry to say it but we will all die on the island,” says Kakali.</A1> <D3><D1>Food and fuel are already more expensive than on the mainland.</D1></D3> Even in summer <D2>the island has only three shops, two restaurants</D2> and not a single official hotel. <A3>“This is an expensive island. <A2>Everything, even milk or bread, has been bought and sold three or four times before it gets to us and everyone has to take a profit,”</A2> said Provatas Costas,</A3> a 58-year-old fisherman.

Ele: The sales tax break was created to help people on islands survive when lots of people were emigrating. Islands that are popular with tourists, such as Mykonos, fear that losing the tax break will make things very hard for them. But, for Agios Efstratios, it is a much bigger problem. <A1>“If we have to pay a tax of 23%, we will all die on the island,” says Kakali.</A1> <D3><D1>Food and fuel are already more expensive than on mainland Greece.</D1></D3> Even in summer, <D2>the island has only three shops, two restaurants</D2> and not one official hotel. <A3>“This is an expensive island. <A2>Everything, even milk or bread, has been bought and sold three or four times by middlemen before it gets to us and so is very expensive,”</A2> said Provatas Costas, a 58-year-old fisherman.</A3>

Adv: For Agios Efstratios and its closest large neighbor, Lemnos, the timing of the crisis is particularly cruel. <A1><A3><D2>They were condemned to relative obscurity for years in part because they are served by slow and unreliable ferries.</D2></A3> In 2015, the government had finally given the contract to a new, efficient company, drawing floods of new visitors to explore the islands’ largely overlooked charms,</A1> <A2>before the bank controls hit. <D3>“This season started out as the best season in 30 years and, in one week, became the worst,”</D3></A2> said <D1>Atzamis Konstantinos, a travel agent in Lemnos</D1> who used to earn €15,000 a month as a captain of petroleum tankers and other large ships but came home because he missed it so much.

Adv: <A1><D3>Lemnos has dozens of wild beaches,</D3> where even at the height of summer you can swim and sunbathe virtually alone, a small nightlife scene, and <D2>numerous cultural sites.</D2></A1> <A2><A3>Lemnos is the eighth largest island in Greece</A3> so it is in line for the first round of tax increases in autumn 2015</A2> but far less wealthy than many smaller ones. <D1>It has just over 3,000 beds for visitors,</D1> compared with tens of thousands on an island such as Rhodes. Its councilors say that they will fight the tax rise, although none can say how. “We have been suffering economically in recent years and, now, we will suffer more,” said Lemnos Mayor, Dimitris Marinakis. “When there is not enough money, you reduce your consumption and therefore the whole economy declines.”

# Paragraph

Adv: <D2>If taxes go up, even more young people will leave,</D2> warns Mayor Kakali, who has devoted her year in office to improving education on the island to help keep it an attractive place for families. <A3><A1>Because it is one of the smallest islands, Agios Efstratios has until 2017 before the rise is due to come in, so Kakali hopes that the roller coaster of Greek politics means it yet may be spared.</A1></A3> <A2><D1>If not, though, she plans to travel to Athens to remind the distant government what the tax rise would cost.</D1> “The truth is the government doesn’t pay much attention to <D3>the islands of the north Aegean,”</D3> she said, “so I would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament, to tell them: ‘There is still life in these islands’.”</A2>

Int: <D2>If taxes go up, even more young people will leave,</D2> warns Mayor Kakali, who has worked to improve education on the island to help keep it an attractive place for families. <A3><A1>Because it is one of the smallest islands, Agios Efstratios has until 2017 before the tax rise comes in.

Ele: <D2>If taxes go up, more young people will leave,</D2> warns Mayor Kakali. <A3><A1>Because it is one of the smallest islands, Agios Efstratios will not have to pay the tax increase until 2017.
