On the Trail of the Wolf


# Paragraph

Adv: Robert Myslajek stops dead. <A1>Between two paw prints on a muddy mountain track, the scientist finds what he is looking for. <A3><D2>“Droppings!” he enthuses. Wolf sightings are so rare that the sighting of their feces marks a good day, even for a seasoned tracker.</D2></A3></A1> But it is getting easier. <D3>There are now an estimated 1,500 wolves in Poland. The number has doubled in 15 years.</D3> Wolves are – along with the brown bear, the lynx and the wolverine – Europe’s last large predator carnivores. <A2><D1>Conservationists from Britain, Germany and the Netherlands are beating a path here to find out how Poland has saved this protected species,</D1> slandered even in fairy tales.</A2>

# Paragraph

Adv: The scientist, who is a familiar face on Polish television, says wolves are exceptional animals that are capable of moving up to 30km during a single hunt. “The Beskidy pack is a strong unit, eight or nine individuals. This year, we have recorded five cubs, two yearlings and two adults. <A3><A1>We track them using motion-activated cameras in the forest and by following their prints in the mud and snow.</A1></A3> In each family group, only one pair reproduces, once a year. <D2>All pack members care for the young with solidarity and devotion.”</D2> <A2>Myslajek, the son of a shepherd, is puzzled by wolves’ bad reputation. “Why does one speak of a 'lone-wolf gunman'? Why did we have to have Little Red Riding Hood, with its big bad wolf?”</A2> He is fascinated by these aloof canines who remained in the wild 33,000 years ago when <D1>others decided on a much more comfortable existence as <D3>domestic dogs.</D3></D1>

# Paragraph

Adv: Wolves are not pooches. Myslajek says only scientific arguments – <D1>the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population</D1> – can save Europe’s wild carnivores, especially the unpopular wolf. <A1>“Natural predators balance the ecosystem. <D2>They keep herbivores in check,</D2> thus allowing trees to grow tall for birds to nest in.”</A1> <A2><A3>The ban on wolf hunting in the western Carpathian mountains came into force in 1995 and nationwide in Poland in 1998.</A3> <D1>There are now resident packs <D3>in virtually all the country’s major forests.</D3></D1> The predators coexist with humans rather than being fenced off, as they are in African safari parks.</A2> 

Int: Myslajek says only scientific arguments – the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population – can save Europe’s wild carnivores, especially the unpopular wolf. <A1>“Natural predators balance the ecosystem. <D2>They reduce the number of herbivores,</D2> which allows trees to grow tall for birds to nest in.”</A1> <A2><A3>The ban on wolf hunting in the western Carpathian mountains became law in 1995 and in the whole of Poland in 1998.</A3> <D1>There are now wolf packs in <D3>nearly all the country’s major forests</D3></D1> where the wolves coexist with humans.</A2>

# Paragraph

Adv: The survival of Poland’s wolves has been helped by the country’s belated infrastructure development. In 1989, <D1>when the communists relinquished power,</D1> Poland had only one motorway. <D2>Major road projects – requiring wildlife impact studies – began after Poland joined the European Union in 2004. The country now has one of the highest densities in the world of overhead crossings and underpasses for wild animals.</D2> <A3><A1>Attitudes have also changed. “For many years, hunting was cultural. In 1975, there were fewer than 100 wolves in Poland.</A1></A3> Beginning in the 1950s, hunting wolves had been encouraged by the authorities. They paid a reward for killing a wolf worth a month’s salary. It was carnage.” <A2>Myslajek says the improvement in Polish wolves’ survival chances has been considerable but remains fragile. <D3>Packs are mobile across borders and hunting still goes on in neighboring Russia, Lithuania and Belarus.</A2></D3>

Int: Poland’s wolves have been helped by the country’s late infrastructure development. In 1989, <D1>when the communists left power,</D1> Poland had only one motorway. <D2>Major road projects began after Poland joined the European Union in 2004 and they are required to consider wild animals.</D2> <A3><A1>Attitudes have also changed. “For many years, hunting was cultural. In 1975, there were fewer than 100 wolves in Poland.</A1></A3> From the 1950s, hunting wolves was encouraged by the authorities. They paid a reward for killing a wolf worth a month’s salary. It was carnage.’’ <A2>Myslajek says that Polish wolves are much safer now but they are not completely safe. <D3>Packs of wolves cross country borders and hunting still happens in neighboring Russia, Lithuania and Belarus.</A2></D3>

Ele: Poland didn’t have many big roads until recently and this has helped wolves. In 1989, <D1>when the communists left power,</D1> Poland had only one motorway. <D2>Major road projects began after Poland joined the European Union in 2004 and they now have to consider wild animals.</D2> <A3><A1>The way people think about wolves has also changed. “For many years, hunting was a part of the culture in Poland. In 1975, there were fewer than 100 wolves in Poland.”</A1></A3> <A2>Myslajek says that Polish wolves are much safer now but they are not completely safe. <D3>Packs go into neighboring countries – Russia, Lithuania and Belarus – where there is still hunting.</A2></D3>

# Paragraph

Adv: <A1>He claims Poland’s new government, elected in October 2015, is hostile to wolves. <A3>“The Environment Minister, Jan Szyszko, makes no secret of being a hunter. <D2>There are 120,000 licensed hunters in Poland and they are influential in parliament.</D2> Being a wolf advocate is not easy.</A3></A1> <D1>It is not as if you can argue to the politicians that wolves are a big <D3>tourist attraction.</D3></D1> <A2><D3>Most tourists</D3> want to see the animals but wolves stay away from humans.
