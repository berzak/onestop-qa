Can the US Electric Bike Market Get a Jump Start?


# Paragraph

Adv: When <A1>Larry Pizzi</A1> first heard about <D1>electric bikes <D3>nearly 20 years ago,</D3></D1> he asked: “Why would anyone want to screw up a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it?” It’s a question that still puzzles traditionalists. Bicycle shops have been slow to stock e-bikes, even though they have been around since the late 1990s. Sales in the US have been modest. <A3><A1>Pizzi, who is now CEO of <D2>Currie Technologies, the number one seller of e-bikes in the US,</D2></A1></A3> believes that’s about to change. Others in the industry agree. <A2>Familiar brands including Trek, Raleigh and Specialized all offer electric models and they’re betting the market is about to take off.</A2> “We’re on the cusp of mainstream adoption,” Pizzi said. “There are more players entering the category, it seems, with every passing month.”

Adv: The companies that make and sell e-bikes say they can overcome those obstacles.
