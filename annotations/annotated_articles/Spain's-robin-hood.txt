# Paragraph

Adv: While the same actions would probably be better understood in today’s Spain, he said that they would not be needed. <D3><D2><D1>The anti-capitalist movement has grown from a fringe movement to one supported by thousands of Spaniards, he said, evidenced by the widely supported movements such as the Indignados.</D1></D2></D3> Duran is widening his focus to include Spain’s justice system, by promoting restorative justice. <A1>“The people in Spain who believe that banks don’t work, they think that I don’t owe anything. I also think that,” he said. “But there is a part of a population that is not in agreement with us and I think I should respond to that.”</A1> <A2><A3>In his case, he said, the element of reciprocity he could offer to banks might lie in the insight he gleaned from years of obtaining bank loans fraudulently.</A3> He could share his thoughts on “which best practices work and the bad ones that don’t, for the general population and for bank workers”.</A2>
