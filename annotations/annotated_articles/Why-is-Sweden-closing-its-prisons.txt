Why is Sweden Closing its Prisons?


# Paragraph

Adv: <D1>Swedish prisons have long had a reputation around the world for being progressive. But are the country’s prisons a soft option?</D1> The head of Sweden’s prison and probation service, <D3>Nils Oberg, announced in November 2013 that four Swedish prisons are to be closed due to an “out of the ordinary” decline in prisoner numbers.</D3> <A1>Although there has been no <D2>fall in crime rates,</D2> between 2011 and 2012 there was a 6% drop in Sweden’s prisoner population, now a little over 4,500.</A1> A similar decrease is expected in 2013 and 2014. <A3><A2>Oberg admitted to being puzzled by the unexpected dip, but expressed optimism that the reason was to do with how his prisons are run. “We certainly hope that the efforts we invest in rehabilitation and preventing relapse of crime has had an impact,” he said.</A2></A3>

# Paragraph

Adv: <D3>“The modern prison service in Sweden is very different from when I joined as a young prison officer in 1978,” says Kenneth Gustafsson, governor of Kumla Prison, Sweden’s most secure jail. However, he doesn’t think the system has gone soft. “When I joined, the focus was very much on humanity in prisons. <D2>Prisoners were treated well – maybe too well,</D2> some might say.</D3> <A3><A1>But, after a number of high-profile escapes in 2004, we had to implement changes to make prisons more secure.”</A1></A3> The Swedes still managed to maintain a broadly humane approach to sentencing, even of the most serious offenders: jail terms rarely exceed ten years. <A2>Sweden was the first country in Europe to introduce the electronic tagging of convicted criminals and continues to strive to <D1>minimize short-term prison sentences</D1> wherever possible by using community-based punishments, which have been proven to be more effective at reducing reoffending.</A2>

# Paragraph

Adv: <D3>The overall reoffending rate in Sweden stands at between 30 and 40% over three years – to compare that with another European country, the number is around half that of the UK.</D3> <A1><A3>One likely reason for the relatively low reoffending rate and the low rate of incarceration in Sweden (below 70 per 100,000 head of population) is that <D2>the age of criminal responsibility is set at 15.</D2></A3></A1> In the UK, for example, children aged ten to 17 and young people under the age of 21 record the highest reoffending rates: almost three quarters and two thirds, respectively. A good proportion of these offenders go on to populate adult jails. <A2><D1>In Sweden, no young person under the age of 21 can be sentenced to life</D1> – this is not the case in many other countries – and every effort is made to ensure that as few juvenile offenders as possible end up in prison.</A2>

Int: <D3>The overall reoffending rate in Sweden is between 30 and 40% over three years – to compare that with another European country, the number is around half that of the UK.</D3> <A1><A3>One thing that has kept reoffending down and the number of prisoners in Sweden below 70 per 100,000 people is that <D2>the age of criminal responsibility is 15.</D2></A3></A1> In the UK, for example, children aged ten to 17 and young people under the age of 21 have the highest reoffending rates. <A2><D1>In Sweden, no young person under the age of 21 can be sentenced to life</D1> – this is not the case in many other countries – and they try to keep young offenders out of prison.</A2>

# Paragraph

Adv: One strong reason for the drop in prison numbers might be the amount of post-prison support available in Sweden. <A1><A3>A confident probation service – a government agency – is tasked not only with supervising those on probation but is also guaranteed to provide treatment programs for offenders with drug, alcohol or violence issues.</A3> The service is assisted by around 4,500 lay supervisors – members of the public who <D2>volunteer to befriend and support offenders under supervision.</D2></A1> “In Sweden, we believe very much in the concept of rehabilitation, without being naive of course,” says <A2><D1>Gustafsson.</D1> <D3>“There are some people who will not or cannot change.</D3> But, in my experience, the majority of prisoners want to change, and we must do what we can to help to facilitate that. It is not always possible to achieve this in one prison sentence.”</A2>

Int: One strong reason for the fall in prison numbers might be the amount of post-prison support available in Sweden. <A1><A3>A government-run probation service supervises people on probation and provides treatment programs for offenders with drug, alcohol or violence problems.</A3> The service is helped by around 4,500 members of the public who <D2>volunteer to befriend and support offenders under supervision.</D2></A1> “In Sweden, we believe very much in the idea of rehabilitation,” says <A2><D1>Gustafsson.</D1> <D3>“Of course, there are some people who will not or cannot change.</D3> But, in my experience, the majority of prisoners want to change and we must do what we can to help them.”</A2>

Ele: One reason for the drop in prison numbers might be the amount of post-prison support available in Sweden. <A1><A3>A government-run probation service gives treatment programs to offenders with drug, alcohol or violence problems.</A3> Around 4,500 Swedes help the service – <D2>they volunteer to make friends with and support offenders.</D2></A1> “In Sweden, we believe very much in the idea of rehabilitation,” says <A2><D1>Gustafsson.</D1> <D3>“Of course, there are some people who will not or cannot change.</D3> But, in my experience, most prisoners want to change and we must do what we can to help them.”</A2>
