They are especially fitter, stronger and more powerful than children with birthdays in April or June.</A1></A3> <A2>Dr. Gavin Sandercock of Essex University found in his study that children born in the autumn had “a clear physical advantage” over their classmates.</A2>

# Paragraph

Adv: <D1>The research involved 8,550 boys and girls <D3>aged between ten and 16</D3> from 26 state schools in Essex.</D1> <A3><A1>All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different measures of fitness: stamina, handgrip strength and lower-body power. The results revealed that a child’s month of birth could make “significant” differences to their levels of cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate,</A1></A3> all of which predict how good someone is at sports, in which such attributes are vital. Performances at school sports days in the weeks ahead may bear out the findings. <A2>November-born children were the fittest overall as they had the most stamina and power and were the second strongest.</A2> Those born in October were almost as fit, scoring highest for strength and coming third for power, <D2>with December children close behind.</D2>

The results showed that a child’s month of birth could make big differences to their levels of fitness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate,</A1></A3>  all of which predict how good someone is at sports. <A2>November children were the fittest because they had the most stamina and power and were the second strongest.</A2> Children born in October were almost as fit – they scored highest for strength and came third for power, <D2>with December children close behind.</D2>

Q: What did the study find about stamina, handgrip strength and lower-body power of children?
a: They varied depending on the time of the year during which the child was born
b: They changed significantly between 2007 and 2010 for all children
c: They were different between boys and girls and between different state schools
d: They were similar for children coming from similar family backgrounds

Q: What were the study’s conclusions concerning the stamina, power, and strength of November children compared to other children? # Q,a,b,c,d
a: November children ranked second in strength and first in stamina and power
b: November children scored highest in each category
c: November children came slightly behind December children in one of the categories
d: November children did not differ from children born in other months

Q1: What was one measure the scientists used to assess the children’s fitness? # a,b,c
a: Hand muscle strength
b: Upper body strength
c: Age
d: Time needed to run a mile

# Paragraph

Adv: The gap in physical prowess between children in <D2>the same class</D2> but born in different months was sometimes very wide. <A1>“For example, we found that a boy born in November <D3>can run at least 10% faster, jump 12% higher and is 15% more powerful</D3> than a child of the same age born in April. This is, potentially, a huge physical advantage,”</A1> said Sandercock. <A2>Such gaps could ultimately decide who became a top-level athlete because, as the paper says, <A3><D1>“selection into elite sports may often depend on very small margins or differences in an individual’s physical performance”.</D1></A3></A2> The study, which has been published in the International Journal of Sports Medicine, found that, when scores for the three kinds of fitness were combined, those born in April were the least fit, then those in June. That could see those children excluded from school teams and becoming sporting underachievers, Sandercock said.

Q: What are percentages used for in the passage? # a,d
a: To indicate that November-born children have physical advantages
b: To compare fall-born children born in different years
c: To show how even small differences in physical performance affect selection for elite sports

Q: What can small differences in physical performance determine? # a,b,c,d # b
a: Whether a person will become a professional athlete
b: Whether a top-level sport is considered “elite”
c: Whether a person can compete in a lower weight class
d: Whether a person will develop an interest in sports

Q2: According to Sandercock, what does selection into elite sports often depend on? # Q,a,b,c,d # c
a: Small differences in physical ability
b: The decision of a small selection committee
c: Being in the top 10% to 15% of the population in speed, height and power
d: Persistence and luck

# Paragraph

Adv: The findings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a <D3>double “autumn advantage” – they are already known to have an academic advantage</D3> and, now, they also appear to be better equipped for sports, too. <A1>The authors believe that <D2>autumn-born children’s greater exposure over the summer months, towards the end of pregnancy, to vitamin D</D2> is the most likely explanation.</A1> <A3><A2><D1>John Steele, chief executive of the Youth Sport Trust, said the quality of a young person’s introduction to sports at school can be “a major factor” in their sporting development.</D1> “Children that get a high-quality first experience, which develops their physical literacy, are those that will have greater agility, balance and coordination, and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and excel in sports as they grow up”, he said.</A2></A3>

Adv: <D3><D2>UK Sport could not say if a disproportionately high number of the 1,300 athletes across 47 sports it funds were born in November and October.</D2></D3> <A1>Natalie Dunman, its head of performance pathways, said that, while the differences highlighted in the new findings were borne out by teenagers competing in junior-level competitions, they had disappeared by the time athletes were taking part in adult competitions.</A1> <A3><A2>She said: “Looking at elite, senior athletes, there are <D1>many factors that go into making a champion</D1> and our work hasn’t uncovered anything to suggest that month of birth is one of the key ingredients.”</A2></A3>
