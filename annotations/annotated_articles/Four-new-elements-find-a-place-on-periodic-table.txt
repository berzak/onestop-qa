Four New Elements Find a Place on Periodic Table


# Paragraph

Adv: Such is the lot of the modern-day chemist: you wait ages for a new element to turn up and then four come along at once. <A1><A3>Discovered by researchers in Japan, Russia and the US, the four new elements are the first to be added to the periodic table since 2011, when <D2>elements 114 and 116</D2> were included.</A3></A1> <A2>The new elements, all spectacularly short-lived and highly radioactive, <D1><D3>complete the periodic table’s seventh row</D3></D1></A2> and render science textbooks around the world out of date.

Adv: <A3><A1>To discover the elements, researchers at the three labs slammed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for signature <D2>radioactive decays</D2> that should come from the new elements.</A1></A3> Ununtrium and ununpentium are thought to be metals, while ununseptium could be a <D1>metalloid – a material bearing some metallic properties.

It is hard to know for sure because so few atoms of each element have ever been made. <A2>Paul Karol, chair of the IUPAC panel that verified the elements, said: <D3>“Practical applications of the new elements,</D3> if any, are a long way off because of the difficulty in synthesis.”</A2>
