Adv: <A3><A1>To discover the elements, researchers at the three labs slammed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for signature <D2>radioactive decays</D2> that should come from the new elements.</A1></A3> Ununtrium and ununpentium are thought to be metals, while ununseptium could be a <D1>metalloid – a material bearing some metallic properties. The fourth element, ununoctium, may be a noble gas,</D1> like other group-18 elements, helium, neon and argon. It is hard to know for sure because so few atoms of each element have ever been made. <A2>Paul Karol, chair of the IUPAC panel that verified the elements, said: <D3>“Practical applications of the new elements,</D3> if any, are a long way off because of the difficulty in synthesis.”</A2>
