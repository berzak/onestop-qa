# Paragraph

Adv: The regulation eight hours in the office is over. The most important work of the day is done; whatever is left can wait until the morning. This is the point many workers would think about heading for the door. <A1>Yet, for millions of Japanese employees, the thought of clearing away their desks and being at home in time for dinner is enough to invite accusations of <D3><D2>disloyalty to the company.</D2></D3></A1> <A3><A2>But, after decades of giving companies carte blanche to milk every last drop of productivity from their workforce, a challenge to Japan’s ingrained culture of overwork has come from the government, which is considering making it a legal requirement for workers to <D1>take at least five days’ paid holiday a year.</D1></A2></A3>
