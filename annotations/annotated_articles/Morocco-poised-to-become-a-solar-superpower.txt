Morocco Poised to Become a Solar Superpower


# Paragraph

Adv: The Moroccan city of Ouarzazate is used to big productions. It is on the edge of the Sahara Desert and at the center of Morocco’s “Ouallywood” film industry. <A3><A1>Now, the trading city is the location for a complex of four linked <D2>solar mega-plants, which, alongside hydro and wind,</D2> will help provide nearly half of Morocco’s electricity from renewables by 2020 with, it is hoped, some spare to export to Europe.</A1> The project is a key plank in Morocco’s ambitions to use its deserts to become a global solar superpower.</A3> When the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world and <D1>the first phase, called Noor 1, will go live in November 2015.</D1> <A2><D3>The mirror technology it uses is less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that are now familiar on roofs the world over</D3> but it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down.</A2>

Adv: The potential for solar power from the desert has been known for decades. <A1>In the days after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, the German particle physicist Gerhard Knies calculated that the world’s deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to <D2>provide for humanity’s power needs for a whole year.</D2></A1> The challenge, though, has been capturing that energy and transporting it to the population centers where it is required. <A3><A2><D1>Experts expect that solar energy will make up a third of Morocco’s renewable energy supply by 2020,</D1> with wind and hydro taking the same share each.</A2></A3> <D3>“We are very proud of this project,” Morocco’s environment minister, Hakima el-Haite said. “I think it is the most important solar plant in the world.”</D3>

Adv: <A3><A1>Technicians say that the Noor 2 and 3 plants, due to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours – opening <D2>the prospect of 24/7 solar energy in the Sahara</D2> and the surrounding region. But, even as the first phase of the project nears completion, Morocco is eyeing grander international ambitions. “We are already involved in high tension transportation lines to cover the full south of Morocco and Mauritania as a first step,”</A1></A3> says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of the national renewable energy investment company. <D3><D1>But he says the project’s ultimate impact will go far wider – even as far as the Middle East. Whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen).</D1></D3> <A2>Talks are ongoing with Tunisia and energy exports northwards across the Mediterranean remain a key goal.</A2>

Int: <A3><A1>Technicians say that the Noor 2 and 3 plants, due to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours – this gives <D2>the possibility of 24/7 solar energy in the Sahara</D2> and the surrounding region. The first part of the project is nearly completed and Morocco has bigger international ambitions. “We are already involved in transportation lines to cover the full south of Morocco and Mauritania,”</A1></A3> says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of the national renewable energy investment company. <D3><D1>But he says the project’s effects will go further – even as far as the Middle East.

Adv: <A3><A1><D2>“We believe that it’s possible to export energy to Europe but, first, we would have to build the interconnectors which don’t yet exist,”</D2> said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman.</A1></A3> “Specifically, we would have to build interconnections, which would not go through the existing one in Spain, and, then, start exporting.” Spain has itself prohibited new solar projects because of a lack of interconnectors to transmit the energy to France. <A3><A1>In the meantime, Morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs for resource independence.</A1></A3> <A2><D3>This could, one day, include the removal of salt from sea water,</D3> in a country that is increasingly being hit by drought as the climate warms.</A2> <D1>Officials are keenly aware of the running they are making in what is the most advanced renewable energy program in the Middle East and North African region.</D1> “We are at the avant-garde of solar,” el-Kadiri says.
