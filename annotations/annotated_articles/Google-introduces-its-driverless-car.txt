# Paragraph

Adv: <A1><D3><D2>Unveiling a car with a top speed of 25mph, two seats and no pedals or steering wheel</D2></D3> might not make much of an impression at a motor show. But Google, in the US, sent a minor earthquake through the car and taxi industries as it unveiled the latest version of its driverless car.</A1> The electrically powered vehicle, which Google has begun testing around its headquarters in Mountain View, California, <A3><D1>dispenses with all the normal controls, including foot pedals.</D1> <A2>Instead, it has a smartphone app that summons it and tells it the destination,</A2> and a single STOP button mounted between the two front-facing seats in case the occupants need to override the computer.</A3>

# Paragraph

Adv: <D1>The car, in fact, takes over all the tasks of navigation, steering, acceleration and braking. The company is building about 100 prototypes for a two-year test.</D1> <D2>The company’s co-founder, <A3><A1>Sergey Brin, told a conference in California</A1></A3> that the vehicle was “still in the prototype stage” but that <A3><A1>the project was “about changing the world for people who are not well served by transportation today.”</A1></A3></D2> He said of the car: “You’re just sitting there; no steering wheel, no pedals. <A2><D3>For me, it was very relaxing.</D3> About ten seconds after getting in, I forgot I was there. It reminded me of catching a chairlift by yourself – a bit of solitude I found really enjoyable.”</A2>
