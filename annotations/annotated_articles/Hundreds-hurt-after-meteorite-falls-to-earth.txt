Hundreds Hurt after Meteorite Falls to Earth


# Paragraph

Adv: <A1>Galina Zaglumyonova was woken in her flat in central Chelyabinsk by an enormous explosion that blew in the balcony windows and shattered clay pots containing her few houseplants.</A1> When she jumped out of bed <D1>she could see a huge vapor trail</D1> hanging in the morning sky and hear the wail of car alarms from the street below. “I didn’t understand what was going on,” said Zaglumyonova. “There was a big explosion and then a series of little explosions. <D3><D2>My first thought was that it was a plane crash.”</D2></D3> What she had actually witnessed were the death throes of a ten-ton meteorite that plunged to Earth in a series of fireballs just after sunrise. <A3><A2>Officials put the number of people injured at almost 1,200, with more than 40 taken to hospital – most as a result of flying glass shattered by the sonic boom created by the meteorite’s descent. There were no reported deaths.</A2></A3>

Adv: The meteorite entered the atmosphere traveling at a speed of at least 33,000mph and broke up into chunks <D2>between 18 and 32 miles</D2> above the ground, according to a statement from the Russian Academy of Sciences. <A1><A3>The event caused panic in Chelyabinsk, a Russian city of one million people to the south of the Ural mountains,</A3></A1> as mobile phone networks swiftly became jammed by the volume of calls.
