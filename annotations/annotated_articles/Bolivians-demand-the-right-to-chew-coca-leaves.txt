# Paragraph

Adv: <D1>However, the UN’s <D3>International Narcotics Control Board (INCB),</D3> which monitors implementation of the global drug treaties, has accused <D2>Bolivia of threatening the integrity of the international drug control regime.</D2></D1> <A1>A number of countries – including the UK, the US, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Russia – opposed Bolivia’s demands. The UK’s submission to the UN, which oversees the convention, told the UN that it “acknowledges and respects the cultural importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia,”</A1> but it adds: <A3><A2>“The United Kingdom is … concerned that the reservation could lead to increases in coca production and – most importantly – the amount of coca diverted to the cocaine trade. As such, the reservation would weaken international law as it relates to the global effort to tackle the illegal drugs trade and could weaken the international community’s response to that trade.”</A2></A3>

Int: <D1>However, the UN’s <D3>International Narcotics Control Board (INCB),</D3> which checks implementation of global drug treaties, says that <D2>Bolivia is threatening international drug controls.</D2></D1> <A1>A number of countries – including the UK, the US, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Russia – opposed Bolivia’s demands.

As a result, the exemption would weaken … the global effort to tackle the drugs trade.”</A2></A3>

Ele: <D1>But the UN’s <D3>International Narcotics Control Board (INCB),</D3> which checks global drug agreements, says <D2>Bolivia may harm international drug controls.</D2></D1> <A1>Many countries – including the UK, the US, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Russia – do not want to give Bolivia what it is asking for. The UK told the UN that it “respects the cultural importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia,”</A1> but it adds: <A3><A2>“The United Kingdom is worried that the exemption could lead to more coca production and – most importantly – more coca reaching the cocaine trade. The exemption would make it more difficult to control the illegal drugs trade.”</A2></A3>

# Paragraph

Adv: <D3>The right of indigenous communities in South America’s Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964</D3> when <D1><D2>Bolivia was under a dictatorship</D2> and it signed up to the convention.</D1> But Bolivia was given 25 years to implement the ban. This expired in 1989 and since then the issue has been under dispute. <A1>In 2011, Bolivia formally notified the UN of its withdrawal from the convention. On Friday it reacceded to the convention, but with an exemption from the prohibition on the chewing of coca leaves.</A1> The move is the first of its kind in the history of UN drug-control treaties and has sparked concerns that other countries may apply for amendments. <A3><A2>Russia has argued that the move will lead to “an increase in illegal circulation of cocaine” and warned that “it also sets a dangerous precedent that could be used by other states in creating a more liberal drug-control regime.”</A2></A3>

# Paragraph

Adv: <D3>The British parliament has recommended that Bolivia’s request should be backed by the UK government,</D3> arguing that it was important that countries remained within the single convention. <A1><D2>Bolivia’s re-accession could be blocked only if a third or more of the <D3>184 countries</D3> that have signed up to the convention opposed its request.</D2></A1> There are suspicions that the US and UK are frantically lobbying other countries to gain sufficient numbers to block Bolivia’s request. <A2>Nancie Prud’homme,</A2> of the International Center on Human Rights and Drug Policy, criticized the co-ordinated opposition to Bolivia’s demands. <A3><A2>“These objections are legally questionable,” she said. “They support an arbitrary and over-broad provision and apply international drug laws in a vacuum. This is not appropriate. There are established international norms on <D1>cultural and indigenous rights,</D1> so we should support Bolivia’s efforts.”</A2></A3>

# Paragraph

Adv: <A3><A1>The decision to ban coca chewing was based on a 1950 report produced by the UN Commission of Inquiry on the Coca Leaf, which proponents of drug liberalization say was <D2>not based on supporting evidence.</D2></A1></A3> In an interview in 1949, the head of the Commission, Howard B Fonda, signaled his opposition to the chewing of coca leaves before his inquiry had begun. Fonda told an interviewer: “We believe that the daily, inveterate use of coca leaves by chewing … is thoroughly noxious and therefore detrimental.” The growing of coca leaves is legal and licensed in Bolivia. <A2>The policy has been credited with <D1>a fall in cocaine production in the country,</D1> leading <D3>some experts to see the Bolivian model as a way forward for other countries.</D3></A2>
