Adv: <A3>The invention of farming brought humans and animals into much closer contact and <D2>humans likely evolved more robust immune systems to fend off infections that the animals passed on.</D2> But scientists may have overestimated the impact farming had in shaping the human immune system, <A1>because tests on the hunter-gatherer’s DNA found that he already carried mutations that boost the immune system to tackle various nasty bugs.</A1></A3> <D3><D1>Some live on in modern Europeans today.</D1></D3> <A2>“Before we started this work, I had some ideas of what we were going to ﬁnd,” said Carles Lalueza-Fox, who led the study at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona. “Most of those ideas turned out to be completely wrong.”</A2>

c: Modern Europeans have relatively weak immune systems
d: Since the time of the hunter-gatherers, immune systems have been dependent on a healthy diet

Q: What does Lalueza-Fox say about the study results?
a: She found them to be surprising
b: They supported her previous ideas
c: They show how humans developed better immune systems to deal with infections from farm animals
d: They describe the appearance of the Mesolithic man with unprecedented accuracy

Q1: What did scientists assume about the hunter-gatherer’s immune system before the DNA tests of this study?
a: The invention of farming had a significant impact on its development
b: Hunter-gatherers had highly developed immune systems
c: Europeans had stronger immune systems than other populations
d: It was very similar to the immune systems of Neanderthals

Adv: The Spanish team started their work after a group of cavers stumbled upon two skeletons in a deep and complex <D2>cave system</D2> high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006. <D1>The human remains, which belonged to two men in their early 30s,</D1> had been <D3><D2>extremely well preserved by the cool environment of the cave.</D2></D3> <A1>Carbon dating put the remains at around 7,000 years old, before farming had swept into Europe from the Middle East.</A1> <A3><A2>The timing ﬁtted with ancient artifacts found at the site, including perforated reindeer teeth that were strung and hung from the people’s clothing.</A2></A3>

Adv: <A3><A1>On top of the scientiﬁc impact, artists might have to rethink their drawings of the people. “You see a lot of reconstructions of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin. You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eye color,”</A1></A3> Lalueza-Fox said. <D2>The Spanish team</D2> went on to compare the genome of the hunter-gatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related. <A2>They found that the ancient DNA most closely matched the genetic makeup of <D3><D1>people living in northern Europe, in particular Sweden and Finland.</D1></D3></A2>

Ele: <A3><A1>This discovery is important for science. It is also important to artists who will have to draw Mesolithic people in a new way. “You see a lot of pictures of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin.

Q: How will the discovery impact how artists should portray Mesolithic hunter-gatherers?
a: They should start drawing Mesolithic hunter-gatherers with dark skin and blue eyes
b: They should start drawing light-skinned Mesolithic hunter-gatherers
c: They should start using modern people from Sweden and Finland as models
d: They should start featuring females more prominently when depicting Mesolithic societies

Q: Which of these nationalities has DNA most closely related to Mesolithic hunter-gatherers?
a: Northern European
b: European, with the exception of Sweden and Finland 
c: Spanish
d: Nationalities outside of Europe

Q1: How are Mesolithic hunter-gatherers currently portrayed through art?
a: As modern Europeans
b: As dark-skinned Europeans
c: As northern Europeans
d: As a diverse population of Europeans with varying skin tones
