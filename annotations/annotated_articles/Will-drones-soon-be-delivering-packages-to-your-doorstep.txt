Will Drones Soon Be Delivering Packages to Your Doorstep


# Paragraph

Adv: How far away are we from a world where drones deliver packages? <D3>If Amazon is to be believed, not far at all.</D3> <D1>Others are not so sure:</D1> technical progress past this point isn’t merely a matter of invention; it’s a matter of public safety. <A1>Paul Misener, Amazon’s vice-president of global public policy, told a congressional hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place. <A3>The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) will finally have regulations governing the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016.</A3></A1> <D2>But the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines aren’t airway-legal at all yet – only drones up to 25kg will be covered</D2> and <A2>the FAA points out in the proposed rules that, if you’re going to crowd the skies with radio-controlled flying robots, they had better all be using different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack.</A2> 

Int: Will we soon live in a world where drones deliver packages? <D3>If you believe Amazon, the answer is “yes”.</D3> <D1>Others are not so sure:</D1> we need to make more technical progress in this area but there is also the problem of public safety. <A1>Amazon spokesman Paul Misener told a US congress hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place. <A3>The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) will finally have regulations on the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016.</A3></A1> <D2>But the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines aren’t legal yet – only drones up to 25kg will be legal.</D2> <A2>And the FAA says that, if you’re going to crowd the skies with radio-controlled flying robots, they must all use different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack.</A2>

Ele: One day, drones could deliver packages to your home. <D3>When will this happen? If you believe Amazon, it will be soon.</D3> <D1>Other people are not so sure.</D1> They have to invent the right technology but, also, they have to consider public safety. <A1>Amazon says that they will be ready as soon as the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) introduce rules for using drones. <A3>The FAA will finally introduce rules for using unmanned aircraft by June 2016.</A3></A1> <D2>But the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines aren’t legal yet – only drones up to 25kg will be legal.</D2> <A2>And the FAA says in the rules they want to introduce that drones will all have to use different radio frequencies that nobody can block or hijack.</A2>

Q: When does Amazon claim it will be ready to deliver packages using drones?
a: Once the FFA releases their rules
b: Once the FFA approves Amazon’s existing drones
c: Amazon says it is not sure when this will happen
d: Once the FFA regulations are approved by Congress in 2017

Q: What will be included in FAA’s new drone rules regarding radio frequencies?
a: All drones must operate at different radio frequencies
b: Drones that were jammed or hijacked must switch to a different frequency 
c: Drones over 25kg will have their own frequency bandwidth
d: Not all frequencies will be allowed to be used by drones

Q1: When will the FAA release regulations on drones?
a: June 2016, or before
b: After June 2016
c: Soon, but the exact date is not specified
d: They were already released at the time this article was written

Adv: Professor Sanjiv Singh, who runs a cargo delivery company called NearEarth, said that <D3><D1>piloting a state-of-the-art drone was a little more like leaving it a trail of breadcrumbs: go to this altitude, perform this short task, go back home.</D1></D3> But even short flights from a mobile landing pad pose serious logistical problems, he said. “They’re not proposing to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; they’re proposing to deliver from a warehouse to where the consumer is, which is likely an urban area,” he said. “There are going to be hazards along the way that the vehicle is going to have to detect. Maybe there will be terrain that the map doesn’t know about. Even then, maybe there’s construction equipment that wasn’t there but is there now. <A1><A3><D2>Maybe GPS signals are blocked,</D2> in which case it’s going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.”</A3></A1> <A2>All this is surmountable, he said – but it’s difficult.</A2>

Int: Professor Sanjiv Singh, who runs a cargo delivery company called NearEarth, said that, <D3><D1>to pilot a state-of-the-art drone, you simply give it some basic instructions: go to this altitude, perform this short task, go back home.</D1></D3> But even short flights from a mobile landing pad could cause serious logistical problems, he said. “They’re not going to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; they’re going to deliver from a warehouse to the consumer, which will probably be an urban area,” he said. “There are going to be hazards that the vehicle is going to have to see. Maybe there will be terrain that the map doesn’t know about. Then, maybe there’s construction equipment that wasn’t there before but is there now. <A1><A3><D2>Maybe GPS signals are blocked,</D2> in which case it’s going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.”</A3></A1> <A2>All these problems can be solved, he said – but it’s difficult.</A2>

Ele: Professor Sanjiv Singh, who works for delivery company NearEarth, said that <D3><D1>flying drones is quite simple – you just give it some basic instructions: go to this height, do this short task, go back home.</D1></D3> But even short flights from a mobile landing place could cause serious problems, he said. “They’re not planning to deliver in areas where nobody lives; they’re planning to deliver from a warehouse to the consumer, which will probably be in a town or city,” he said. “The drone will have to see hazards. Maybe there will be things that the map doesn’t know about. Maybe there will be construction equipment that wasn’t there but is there now. <A1><A3><D2>Maybe GPS signals will be blocked</D2> so it’s going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.”</A3></A1> <A2>All this can be solved, he said – but it’s difficult.</A2>

Q: Why does Sanjiv mention GPS systems?
a: To provide an example of a critical problem that may arise during drone flight
b: To argue that people have incorrect ideas about how they work in drones
c: To illustrate how easy it is to fly drones 
d: To discuss how common they are

Q: What does Professor Singh think about fixing current drone delivery problems?
a: He thinks that it is possible to resolve these problems
b: He believes the problems might be too difficult to fix
c: He thinks that blocked GPS signals will be the hardest problem to fix
d: He believes that his company will be the first to offer solutions to the problems

Q1: What is Professor Singh worried will happen when the drone is unable to access GPS signals?
a: It will have unreliable knowledge of its current location
b: It will deliver to an incorrect location
c: It will be unable to follow simple instructions like “go to this height”
d: It will stop responding to control commands from the operator

Adv: One major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks. <D3><A1>“If you have an off-the-shelf UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle), <D2>it’ll just keep going and crash into the ground,” said roboticist Daniel Huber.</D2></A1></D3> “Technologically, most of the things that are needed for this are in place,” said Huber. <A3><A2>He is working on a program that proposes using drones to inspect infrastructure – pipelines, telephone lines, bridges and so on. <D1>“We’ve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and it’ll autonomously fly around that area and look at every surface and then report back.”</D1></A2></A3>

Ele: One big problem is keeping radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks. <D3><A1>”If a drone loses radio contact, <D2>it will keep going and crash into the ground,” said robot expert Daniel Huber.</D2></A1></D3> “We already have most of the technology we need,” said Huber. <A3><A2>He is working on a program that will use drones to check telephone lines, bridges and so on. <D1>“We can make drones fly around a certain area and look at every surface.”</D1></A2></A3>

Q: What currently happens to a typical drone if it loses contact with its human operator?
a: It will collide with the ground
b: It will crash into an obstacle

Adv: Huber said about Amazon: “I have heard them say that many packages are lightweight – a drone can carry a kilogram for 15 minutes. <D3>If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighborhood, it can deliver from that base.</D3> <A3><A1>You need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have about that distance.” It’s one way, he said, of making sure the surrounding population is relatively safe. “The larger the distance the drone travels, the more dangerous it becomes.”</A1></A3> <A2><D1>Of course, safety remains a major concern – Singh points out that, for a commercial aircraft to be considered skyworthy, it has to prove a rate of one serious failure every one million hours.</D1></A2> <D2>Drones, he said, are “one or two orders of magnitude away” from that benchmark. “The Reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours,” Singh said.</D2> An oil leak, by the way, doesn’t count as catastrophic failure – something has to fall out of the sky.

b: Require drones to report their status every 15 minutes
c: Prevent drones from delivering packages from vehicles
d: Inspect drones more frequently

# Paragraph

Adv: Part of this is simply that air travel is inherently dangerous and, thus, standards are much higher. <A3><A1><D2>“If you fly commercial airlines, often they’ll say, ’Oh, a small component has failed – we have to go back to the gate,’”</D2> Singh said. “And that’s an established industry with 60 years of legacy!</A1></A3> <D1><D3>I shudder to think that one of these things might come down on a crowded highway.”</D3></D1> <A2>Part of the solution, Singh said, is comprehensive contingency planning: “If things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.”</A2>

Int: Part of the reason for this is that air travel is dangerous so standards are much higher. <A3><A1><D2>“If you fly commercial airlines, they often say, ‘Oh, a small component has failed – we have to go back to the gate,’”</D2> Singh said. “And that’s an established industry with 60 years of legacy!</A1></A3> <D1><D3>I hate to think that a drone might come down on a busy road.”</D3></D1> <A2>Part of the solution, Singh said, is planning for every situation: “If things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.”</A2>

Ele: Part of the reason for this is simply that air travel is dangerous so standards are much higher. <A3><A1><D2>“If you fly a passenger airplane, often they will say, ‘Oh, a small part isn’t working; we have to go back,’”</D2> Singh said. “And people have been flying passenger airplanes for 60 years!</A1></A3> <D1><D3>I hate to think that a drone might come down on a busy road.”</D3></D1> <A2>Part of the solution, Singh said, is planning for every situation: “If things fail, the drone has to do something sensible.”</A2>

Q: Why does Singh bring up the example of passenger airplanes?
a: To show how many precautions people take when dealing with aircraft
b: To demonstrate how often airplane parts fail
c: To demonstrate how drones should perform when they need to come down on a busy highway
d: To point out how small drones are compared to typical airplanes

Q: What does Singh say drones should do to improve safety?
a: They should have a strategy for handling all circumstances
b: They should have built-in responses to common problems
c: They should always return to their base if a problem occurs 
d: They should land immediately in the event of a problem

Q1: According to Singh, why do passenger airplanes often return to the gate?
a: A small part has failed
b: A passenger identified a problem with the airplane
c: They are in danger of coming down on a busy road
d: Poor weather conditions
