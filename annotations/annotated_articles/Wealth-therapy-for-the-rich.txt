Adv: “I shifted towards it naturally,” he said of his becoming an expert in wealth therapy. <A1><A3>“Many of the extremely wealthy – the 1% of the 1% – feel that their problems are really not problems.</A3></A1> But they are. A lot of therapists do not give enough weight to their issues.” So, what issues are America’s 1% struggling with? <A2>“There is guilt over being rich in the first place,” he said. “There is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich. And, then, there is the isolation – being in the 1%, it turns out, can be lonely.”</A2> It seems F. Scott Fitzgerald was right: the very rich “are different from you and me.” Counselors argue things have become <D3>worse since the financial crisis</D3> and <D2>the debate over income inequality</D2> that has been spurred on by movements like <D1>Occupy Wall Street</D1> and the Fight for $15 fair wage campaign.

Adv: <D1><D3>“The Occupy Wall Street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% and painted them globally as something negative,”</D3></D1> said Jamie Traeger-Muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the Wealth Legacy Group. <A1><D2>The media, she said, is partly to blame for making the rich “feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed”.</D2></A1> <A2><A3>“Sometimes, I am shocked by things that people say. You would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealth holders.”</A3></A2>

Adv: <D1>“It’s really isolating to have a lot of money.</D1> People’s reactions to you can be scary,” said Barbara Nusbaum, an expert in money psychology. <A3><A1><D2>“We are all taught not to talk about money. It’s not polite to talk about money.</D2> Ironically, it’s harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money. It’s much more socially acceptable to say ‘I am broke. Things are hard.’ You can’t say ‘I have a ton of money.’</A1></A3> <A2><D3>You have to keep a lot of your life private.” As a result, Cockrell points out, the rich tend to hang out with other rich Americans, not out of snobbery but in order to be around those who understand them and their problems.</D3></A2>

Adv: In the US, over the last three decades, the number of extremely wealthy people has been climbing. <A1>According to research from Spectrem Group, in 2014, <D3>the number of US households with <D2>$1m or more</D2> in assets –  excluding the value of their primary home – increased</D3> by 500,000 to 10.1m.</A1> In 2007, that number was 9.2m. Households worth $5m or more reached 1.3m and <D1>142,000</D1> households are now worth $25m or more. <A3><A2>Since the 2008 financial crisis, the income gap has expanded and the situation “has gotten worse for the wealthy,” Cockrell said. The main reason? Not knowing if your friends are friends with you or your money. “Someone else who is also a billionaire – they don’t want anything from you. Never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means, I think that is difficult,” said Cockrell. “As the gap has widened, the rich have become more and more isolated.”</A2></A3>
