# Paragraph

Adv: Crunchy, full of protein and to be found under a rock near you.

Int: Insects are not usually <D2>seen as food except in a few regions of the world</D2> – but now they are crawling closer and closer to our plates. <A1>In spring 2013 there will be an effort to show people that eating insects is not disgusting and also <D3>an attempt to put insects on supermarket shelves.</D3></A1> In April, there will be a festival in London, Pestival 2013, where the consumption of creepy-crawlies will be discussed. <A3><A2>The festival will include a restaurant by the Nordic Food Lab, the Scandinavian team behind the Danish restaurant Noma, which brought <D1>dishes that included ants to Claridge’s hotel in London in 2012</D1></A2></A3>

Ele: In the West, people do not usually eat insects. <A1><D2>But in some parts of the world, insects are an important food</D2> and in spring 2013 there will be an effort to show people that eating insects is not disgusting. And we may soon be able to <D3>buy insects in supermarkets.</D3></A1> In April, there will be a festival in London, Pestival 2013, where there will be a discussion about the question of eating insects. <A3><A2>The festival will include a restaurant by the Nordic Food Lab, the Scandinavian team behind the Danish restaurant Noma, <D1>which brought extremely popular insect dishes to Claridge’s hotel in London in 2012.</D1></A2></A3>

Adv: In March, <D2>a BBC documentary will feature food writer Stefan Gates searching out and eating deep-fried locusts and barbecued tarantulas.</D2> <D3>But, behind all the gimmicks and jokes about flies in the soup, there is a deeply serious message.</D3> <A1>Many experts believe there is a clear environmental benefit to humans eating creepy-crawlies.</A1> <A2><A3>The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been funding projects since 2011 aimed at <D1>promoting the eating and farming of insects in south-east Asia and Africa,</D1> where an estimated two billion people already eat insects and caterpillar larvae as a regular part of their diet.</A3></A2> In 2012, the FAO published a list of 1,909 edible species of insect and, with sponsorship from the Dutch government, plans a major international conference on “this valuable food source” in 2013.

Adv: <D2>Over the next 30 years, the planet’s human population will increase to nine billion.</D2> <A1>Already one billion people do not get enough food. The increase will mean more pressure on agricultural land, water, forests, fisheries and biodiversity resources, as well as nutrients and <D3>energy supplies.</D3></A1> <A2><A3>The cost of meat is rising, not just in terms of hard cash but also in terms of the amount of rainforest that is destroyed for grazing or to grow feedstuff for cattle.</A3></A2> There is also the issue of methane excreted by cows. <D1>The livestock farming contribution, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, is enormous – 35% of the planet’s methane,</D1> 65% of its nitrous oxide and 9% of the carbon dioxide.

a: More pressure on farming resources
b: One billion people will not have enough food

Adv: <A1><A3>Edible insects emit few gases, contain high-quality protein, vitamins and amino acids, and have a high food-conversion rate, needing a quarter of the food intake of sheep, and half of pigs and chickens, to produce the same amount of protein.</A3></A1> They emit fewer greenhouse gases and less ammonia than cows and <D1><D2>can be grown on organic waste.</D2></D1> China is already successfully setting up huge maggot farms. <D3>Zimbabwe has a thriving mapone caterpillar industry and Laos was given nearly $500,000 by the FAO to develop an insect-harvesting project.</D3> It’s already big business in the UK, though not always official: a man was recently detained by Gatwick customs as he stepped off a flight from Burkina Faso with 94 kilos of mapone, worth nearly £40,000, in his luggage. <A2>A study by FoodServiceWarehouse.com suggested that swapping pork and beef for crickets and locusts could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 95%.</A2>
