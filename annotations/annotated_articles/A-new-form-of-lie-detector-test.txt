# Title
A New Form of Lie Detector Test


# Paragraph

Adv: Police and intelligence agencies around the world have, for almost 100 years, relied on polygraphs as lie detectors to help convict criminals or unearth spies and traitors. The polygraph is beloved of the movies, with countless dramatic moments showing the guilty sweating profusely as they are hooked up. But the invention could soon be defunct. <A1><A3>Researchers in Britain and the Netherlands have made a breakthrough, developing a method with a success rate in tests of over 70% that <D2>could be in use in police stations around the world within a decade.</D2></A3></A1> <A2>Rather than relying on facial tics, talking too much or waving of arms – all seen as tell-tale signs of lying – <D1><D3>the new method involves monitoring full-body motions</D3></D1> to provide an indicator of signs of guilty feelings.</A2> 

Int: Police and intelligence agencies around the world have, for almost 100 years, used polygraphs as lie detectors to help convict criminals or find spies and traitors. But the polygraph could soon be defunct. <A1><A3>Researchers in Britain and the Netherlands have developed a new method that has a success rate, in tests, of over 70%. <D2>This new method could be in use in police stations around the world within a decade.</D2></A3></A1> <A2>It doesn’t monitor facial tics, talking too much or waving of arms, which are all signs that someone is lying. <D1><D3>The new method monitors full-body motion,</D3></D1> which can show that the person is feeling guilty.</A2>

Ele: Police and intelligence agencies around the world have, for almost 100 years, used the polygraph, a lie-detector test, to help catch criminals and spies. <A1><A3>But, now, researchers in Britain and the Netherlands have developed a new method, which is correct (in tests) over 70% of the time. <D2>Police stations around the world might begin using this new method within ten years.</D2></A3></A1> <A2>It doesn’t monitor movements in the face, talking too much or waving arms – all signs that someone is lying. <D1><D3>The new method monitors movements in the whole body,</D3></D1> which can show that the person is feeling guilty.</A2>

Q: When is the new lie detection method expected to work with over 70% accuracy?
a: It has already achieved this accuracy level in tests
b: Within ten years
c: Once it is modified to monitor movements of the entire body
d: It is currently not known

Q: What does the new method of lie detection monitor that the polygraph does not?
a: Motions in the entire body
b: Talking too much and arm waving
c: Body responses to statements about events within a period of ten years
d: Body temperature

Q1: When are police stations expected to start using the new lie detection method?
a: Within 10 years
b: Once it reaches an accuracy of at least 70%
c: Once it is able to track the movements of the entire body
d: It is already in use in many police stations

# Paragraph

Adv: <D2>The polygraph is widely used in the US in criminal and other cases and for security clearance for the <D1>FBI and CIA</D1> but is much less popular in Europe. <D1>There has been a lot of skepticism in the scientific and legal communities about its reliability.</D1></D2> By contrast, the new method developed by the researchers has performed well in experiments. <A1>The basic premise is that liars fidget more and so the use of an all-body motion suit – the kind used in films to <D3>create computer-generated characters</D3> – will pick this up.</A1> One of the research team, Ross Anderson, said: “Decades of deception research show that the interviewer will tell truth from lies only slightly better than random.” He said the new method, by contrast, achieved a reliability rating of over 70%. <A3>In some tests, the team has already achieved more than 80%. <A2>Anderson said: “The takeaway message is that guilty people fidget more and we can measure this robustly.”</A2></A3>

He said the new method, by contrast, was reliable over 70% of the time. And he was confident they would be able to do better. <A3>In some tests, the team has already achieved more than 80%. <A2>Anderson said: “Guilty people fidget more and we can measure this.”</A2></A3>

Adv: <A1>The polygraph was created in 1921 by policeman John Larson, based on research by the <D3>psychologist William Marston.</D3></A1> It records changes in pulse, blood pressure, sweating and breathing to ascertain whether a subject is lying. <A3><A2>While cinema depictions suggest the device is near-infallible, <D1>the US Supreme Court ruled, in 1998, that there was no consensus that the polygraph was reliable,</D1></A2> <D2>a finding supported by the US National Academy of Scientists</D2> in 2003.</A3>

# Paragraph

Adv: “Overall, <D1>we correctly classified 82.2%</D1> (truths: 88.9%; lies: 75.6%) of the interviewees as either being truthful or deceptive based on the combined movement in their individual limbs,” the report says. Anderson said: “Our first attempt <D2>looked at the extent to which different body parts and body signals indicated deception. It turned out that liars wave their arms</D2> more but, again, this is only at the 55% level that you can get from a conventional polygraph. The pay dirt was when we considered total body motion. That turns out to tell truth from lies over 70% of the time.” <A3><A1>The use of all-body suits is expensive – they cost about £30,000 – and can be uncomfortable, and Anderson and his colleagues are now looking at low-cost alternatives.</A1></A3> <A2>These include using motion-sensing technology from <D3>computer games, such as the Kinect camera devices developed by Microsoft for the Xbox console.</D3></A2>

Int: “Overall, we <D1>correctly guessed whether 82.2%</D1> (truths: 88.9%; lies: 75.6%) of the interviewees were telling the truth or lying based on the movements in their individual limbs,” the report says. Anderson said: “First, <D2>we looked at how much different body parts showed that someone was lying. We found that liars wave their arms</D2> more, but this is only at the 55% level that you can get from a polygraph. The success came when we looked at total body motion. That tells truth from lies over 70% of the time.” <A3><A1>The use of all-body suits is expensive – they cost about £30,000 – and they can be uncomfortable, so Anderson and his colleagues are now studying low-cost alternatives.</A1></A3> <A2>These include using motion-sensing technology from <D3>computer games, such as the Kinect camera devices developed by Microsoft for the Xbox console.</D3></A2>

Ele: The new body-suit method was <D1>correct 82.2% of the time.</D1> Researchers <D2>monitored how much the people moved their arms</D2> and legs, to decide if they were telling the truth or lying. <A3><A1>All-body suits are expensive – they cost about £30,000 – and they can be uncomfortable, so Anderson and his colleagues are now looking at cheaper alternatives.</A1></A3> <A2>These include using motion-sensing technology from <D3>computer games, such as the Kinect camera devices developed by Microsoft for the Xbox console.</D3></A2>
