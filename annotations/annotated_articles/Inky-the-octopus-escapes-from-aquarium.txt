Inky the Octopus Escapes from Aquarium


# Paragraph

Adv: An octopus has made a brazen escape from the National Aquarium in New Zealand by breaking out of its tank, slithering down a 50-meter drainpipe and <D2>disappearing into the sea.</D2> In scenes reminiscent of Finding Nemo, Inky – a common New Zealand octopus – made his dash for freedom after the lid of his tank was accidentally left slightly ajar. <D1>Staff believe that in the middle of the night, while the aquarium was deserted,</D1> Inky clambered to the top of his glass enclosure, down the side of the tank and traveled across the floor of the aquarium. Rob Yarrell, national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, said: <A1>“Octopuses are famous escape artists. I don’t think <D3>he was unhappy with us,</D3> or lonely, as octopuses are solitary creatures.</A1> <A3><A2>But, he is such a curious boy. He would want to know what’s happening on the outside. That’s just his personality.”</A2></A3>

Int: An octopus has escaped from the National Aquarium in New Zealand by leaving its tank, sliding down a 50-meter drainpipe and <D2>disappearing into the sea.</D2> Inky – a common New Zealand octopus – escaped after the lid of his tank was accidentally left a bit ajar. <D1>Staff believe that in the middle of the night, while the aquarium was deserted,</D1> Inky climbed to the top of his glass enclosure, down the side of the tank and traveled across the floor of the aquarium.

Ele: An octopus has escaped from the National Aquarium in New Zealand. It escaped from its tank, slid down a 50-meter drainpipe and <D2>disappeared into the sea.</D2> Inky – a common New Zealand octopus – escaped after someone left the lid of his tank open. <D1>Staff at the aquarium believe that, in the middle of the night, when there was no-one in the building,</D1> Inky climbed down the side of the tank and traveled across the floor. Rob Yarrell, national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, said: <A1>“Octopuses are famous for their ability to escape. I don’t think <D3>he was unhappy</D3> with us, or lonely, because octopuses like to live alone.</A1> <A3><A2>But, he is such a curious boy. He would want to know what’s happening on the outside. That’s his personality.”</A2></A3>

Q: Why does Yarrell mention that octopuses live alone?
a: To provide evidence that Inky did not escape because he was lonely
b: To propose that Inky escaped because there were too many people in the aquarium

# Paragraph

Adv: <A1>One theory is that Inky slid across the aquarium floor – a journey of three or four meters – and then, sensing freedom was at hand, <D3><D2>into a drainpipe that led directly to the sea.</D2> The drainpipe was 50 meters long</D3> and opened onto the waters of Hawke’s Bay, on the east coast of New Zealand’s North Island. Another possible escape route could have involved <D3>Inky squeezing into an open pipe at the top of his tank,</D3> which led under the floor to the drain.</A1> “When we came in the next morning and his tank was empty, I was really surprised,” said <A3><A2><D1>Yarrell, who has not launched a search for Inky. “The staff and I have been pretty sad.</D1></A2> But then, this is Inky and he’s always been a bit of a surprise octopus.”</A3>

Int: <A1>One theory is that Inky slid across the aquarium floor – a journey of three or four meters – and, then, <D3><D2>into a drainpipe that led directly to the sea.</D2> The drainpipe was 50 meters long</D3> and led to the waters of Hawke’s Bay, on the east coast of New Zealand’s North Island. It is also possible that <D3>Inky escaped by squeezing into an open pipe</D3> at the top of his tank, which led under the floor to the drain.</A1> “When we came in the next morning and his tank was empty, I was really surprised,” said <A3><A2><D1>Yarrell, who has not launched a search for Inky. “The staff and I have been pretty sad.</D1></A2> But then, this is Inky and he’s always been a bit of a surprise octopus.”</A3>

Ele: <A1>One idea is that Inky crossed the aquarium floor – a journey of three or four meters – and then, he realized that freedom was very near so he <D3><D2>entered a drainpipe that led directly to the sea.</D2> The drainpipe was 50 meters long</D3> and opened into Hawke’s Bay, on the east coast of New Zealand’s North Island. It is also possible that <D3>Inky escaped through an open pipe</D3> at the top of his tank, which led under the floor to the drain.</A1> “When we came in the next morning and his tank was empty, I was really surprised,” said <A3><A2><D1>Yarrell, who has not started looking for Inky. “The staff and I have been sad.</D1></A2> But then, this is Inky and he’s always been a bit of a surprise octopus.”</A3>

# Paragraph

Adv: Reiss Jenkinson, exhibits keeper at the National Aquarium, said he was absolutely certain Inky had not been taken. “I understand the nature of octopus behavior very well,” he said. “I have seen octopuses on boats slip through bilge pumps. <A3><A1>And, the security here is too tight for anyone to take Inky and why would they?”</A1></A3> <D2>Because octopuses have no bones, they are able to fit into extremely small spaces and have been filmed squeezing through gaps the size of coins.</D2> <A2>They are also understood to be extremely intelligent and capable of using tools. At the Island Bay Marine Education Center in Wellington, an octopus was found to be in the habit of visiting another tank overnight to <D3><D1>steal crabs,</D1></D3> then returning to its own. Another at the center, Ozymandias, was thought to have broken a world record for opening a jar before it was released into the ocean.</A2>

Ele: Reiss Jenkinson, a keeper at the National Aquarium, said he was absolutely certain Inky was not stolen. “I understand octopus behavior very well,” he said. “I have seen octopuses on boats escape through waste pumps. <A3><A1>And, the security here is too good for anyone to take Inky and why would they?”</A1></A3> <D2>Because octopuses have no bones, they can fit into very small spaces and can squeeze through gaps the size of coins.</D2> <A2>They are also very intelligent and able to use tools. At the Island Bay Marine Education Center in Wellington, an octopus visited another tank every night to <D3><D1>steal crabs,</D1></D3> then return to its own tank. Another octopus at the center, Ozymandias, broke a world record for opening a jar.</A2>

Q: How good is the security of the aquarium, according to Jenkinson?
a: Too good for anything to be stolen from the aquarium without the theft being noticed
b: Not great, since the aquarium didn’t think anyone would try to steal from them

b: To explain that octopuses like opening jars
c: To prove that octopuses can squeeze through gaps the size of coins
d: To convey that there were other octopuses in the aquarium

Q1: According to Inky’s keeper, why is it likely Inky wasn’t stolen?
a: No one would have motivation to steal him
b: Security cameras saw him escape
c: It is more common for people to steal crabs
d: It would be hard to keep Inky alive outside of his tank

# Paragraph

Adv: <D3>Inky was brought to the National Aquarium a number of years ago by a local fisherman who found him caught in a crayfish pot.</D3> <A1>He was scarred and “rough looking”, said Yarrell. <A3>“He had been living on the reef and fighting with fish so he wasn’t in the best shape.”</A3></A1> According to Yarrell, Inky – who is about the size of a rugby ball – was an “unusually intelligent” octopus. <D1>“He was very friendly, very inquisitive and a popular attraction here.</D1> <D2>We have another octopus, Blotchy,</D2> but he is smaller than Inky and Inky had the personality.” <A2>The aquarium has no plans to step up security as a result of the escape as Inky was a “one-off” but the staff are “increasingly aware of what octopuses can actually do”. Although the aquarium is not actively searching for a replacement for Inky, if a fisherman brought in another octopus, it might be willing to take it on.</A2> 

Int: <D3>Inky was brought to the National Aquarium several years ago by a local fisherman who found him caught in a fishing pot.</D3> <A1>He was “rough looking”, with very short arms, said Yarrell. <A3>“He had been living on the reef and fighting with fish so he wasn’t in the best shape.”</A3></A1> According to Yarrell, Inky – who is about the size of a rugby ball – was an “unusually intelligent” octopus. <D1>“He was very friendly and a popular attraction here.</D1> <D2>We have another octopus, Blotchy,</D2> but he is smaller than Inky and Inky had the personality.” <A2>The aquarium has no plans to step up security as a result of the escape because they don’t think it will happen again. But, the staff are “more and more aware of what octopuses can do”. Although the aquarium is not looking for a replacement for Inky, if a fisherman brought in another octopus, it might accept it.</A2>
